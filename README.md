The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Film and Video Collection comprises the raw materials — interviews, filmed speeches, performances, demonstrations, conversations, archival footage and B-roll — amassed by Estela and Ernesto Bravo in the making of twenty-five films from Those Who Left in 1980 to Mandela and Fidel in 2013.
