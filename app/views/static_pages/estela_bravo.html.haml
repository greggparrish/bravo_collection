        Estela Bravo was born in Brooklyn in 1933. She attended Brooklyn College at night, where she was president of Students for a Peaceful World (SPW) and worked during the day for the Joint Council of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union. Her life changed in 1953, when she was invited to attend the Fourth World Youth Festival, organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, in Bucharest. That same summer, Estela also attended the International Union of Students gathering in Warsaw, where she met Ernesto Bravo, an activist and survivor of repression in Peronist Argentina. Returning to New York City, Estela started working with the magazine,

        In 1963, when the Cuban government invited Ernesto Bravo, by this time a biochemist and virologist, to join the University of Havana Medical School, the Bravos with their two children moved to Havana. In Cuba, Estela, a once frequent participant in Pete Seeger's "hootenannies," established an English-language folk music radio program,

        Estela's filmmaking career began in the late 1970s, when she was given the opportunity to do a film on the relationship between Cubans and Miami Cubans. That first effort,

        (1980), led to a four decade-long career in documentary filmmaking that continues to take the Bravos around the world. Initially chronicling the effect on families of the troubled relationship between the United States and Cuba, Estela Bravo has gone on to use the camera to document the human dimension of social justice movements throughout Latin America, particularly in Ernesto Bravo's native Argentina and in Chile during the Pinochet era. Having access to key Cuban figures, including Fidel Castro, Estela Bravo has also been able to create an important visual record of Cuban internationalism, most notably in Angola, Grenada and Namibia. Estela Bravo's films have won several awards, including the Silver Hugo Award from the Chicago International Film Festival and an "Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Award" from the Global Village Documentary Festival.
